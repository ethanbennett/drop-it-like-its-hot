# BoxDrop

This may be shocking, after reading the name, but this project emulates the functionality of DropBox. The UI isn't anything too special, but the AWS integration, file storage, and directory organization within a user's account all functions exactly as it should. Check out the site in production, and store your files in a less secure, clunkier version of a perfectly good app!
